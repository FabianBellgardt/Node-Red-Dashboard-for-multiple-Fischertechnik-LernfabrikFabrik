This code allows you to use your Fischertechnik learning factory without the Fischertechnik cloud itself. Just drag and drop this file into your Node-Red environment. To get the information from the learning factory, you can use a Mosquitto broker that has a bridge to each learning factory. You can even control multiple devices from one dashboard. It is recommended to use a system with at least 8 GB of RAM, because with more than 16000 lines of code it is a bit much for Node-Red.

The code supports two learning factorys at the moment. But you can integrate even more. Using tabs on the left side, you can switch between the factories.
